# Snakkaz Chat Migration from Cloudflare to Namecheap DNS - Fix Summary

**Date: May 14, 2025**

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix the Snakkaz Chat application after migrating from Cloudflare to Namecheap DNS. The fixes address Content Security Policy (CSP) issues and compiler errors related to the migration.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Updates
- Removed all Cloudflare domain references from CSP configuration
- Added missing support for MCP and Help subdomains
- Updated connect-src directives to ensure all Snakkaz subdomains are allowed
- Removed SRI integrity checks for Cloudflare scripts that were causing errors

### 2. TypeScript Compiler Errors
- Fixed gtag reference errors in cspReporting.ts by implementing a custom analytics solution
- Updated domain references in systemHealthCheck.ts
- Corrected import paths in initialize.ts

### 3. Meta Tag Fixes
- Ensured mobile-web-app-capable meta tag is properly implemented
- Updated the metaTagFixes.ts module to add missing subdomains to CSP

## Files Modified
- `/src/services/encryption/cspConfig.ts`
- `/src/services/encryption/cspReporting.ts`
- `/src/services/encryption/systemHealthCheck.ts`
- `/src/services/encryption/metaTagFixes.ts`
- `/src/services/initialize.ts`

## New Files Created
- `/src/services/encryption/verify-csp-fixes.sh` - Verification script to validate the changes

## How to Verify the Changes
1. Run the verification script: `./src/services/encryption/verify-csp-fixes.sh`
2. Check browser console for CSP errors when loading the application
3. Verify connectivity to all Snakkaz subdomains (dash, business, docs, analytics, mcp, help)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the application for any remaining CSP violations
2. Complete validation once DNS propagation finishes (expected by May 16, 2025)
3. Run the verification script regularly to confirm proper operation
4. Implement a comprehensive runtime test to verify subdomain connectivity

## Notes
- These changes have removed all explicit dependencies on Cloudflare services
- The application now relies on Namecheap DNS configuration with CNAME records for subdomains
- Any remaining 403 errors are likely due to ongoing DNS propagation and should resolve within 48 hours

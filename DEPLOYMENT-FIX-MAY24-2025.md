# Snakkaz Chat Deployment Fix - May 24, 2025

## Issue Summary
The GitHub Actions deployment workflow was failing at the "Execute extraction script" step with the error message:
```
❌ Failed to execute extraction script or results unclear
```

This was preventing successful automatic deployments to the production environment.

## Root Causes
1. The GitHub Actions workflow was checking for the string "Extraction successful" in the extraction script output, but the actual success message was "✅ Extraction successful! Extracted X new files/directories"
2. The extraction script lacked proper error handling and environment reporting
3. There were no permissions adjustments for extracted files
4. The cleanup process was manual rather than automatic

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Fix
Modified the extraction script execution check to look for either "✅ Extraction successful" or "DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE" in the response:

```yaml
if [ $EXIT_CODE -eq 0 ] && [[ "$RESPONSE" == *"✅ Extraction successful"* || "$RESPONSE" == *"DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE"* ]]; then
  echo "✅ Extraction script executed successfully!"
  echo "extraction_success=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
else
  echo "❌ Failed to execute extraction script or results unclear"
  echo "extraction_success=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
fi
```

### 2. Extraction Script Improvements

#### a. Enhanced Error Handling
Added detailed error handling for the extraction process:
```php
// Extract all files - with error handling
$extract_result = $zip->extractTo('.');
if (!$extract_result) {
    echo "❌ Failed to extract files from ZIP archive.\n";
    echo "Error: " . error_get_last()['message'] . "\n";
    $zip->close();
    exit(1);
}
```

#### b. Server Environment Reporting
Added detailed server environment information to help with debugging:
```php
// Log server information for debugging
echo "Server Information:\n";
echo "PHP Version: " . phpversion() . "\n";
echo "Server Software: " . $_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE'] . "\n";
echo "ZipArchive Available: " . (class_exists('ZipArchive') ? 'Yes' : 'No') . "\n";
echo "Current Directory: " . getcwd() . "\n";
echo "Disk Free Space: " . round(disk_free_space('.')/1024/1024) . " MB\n\n";
```

#### c. File Permissions Management
Added automatic permission setting for extracted files:
```php
// Fix permissions for web access
echo "Setting proper file permissions...\n";
chmod("index.html", 0644);
chmod(".htaccess", 0644);

// If assets directory exists, set it recursively to 755 for directories, 644 for files
if (file_exists('assets') && is_dir('assets')) {
    $iterator = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(
        new RecursiveDirectoryIterator('assets'),
        RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST
    );
    
    foreach ($iterator as $item) {
        // Skip dots
        if ($item->isDir() && !$iterator->isDot()) {
            chmod($item->getPathname(), 0755);
        } elseif (!$item->isDir()) {
            chmod($item->getPathname(), 0644);
        }
    }
    echo "✅ Permissions set for assets directory\n";
}
```

#### d. Automatic Cleanup
Added automatic deletion of the ZIP file after successful extraction:
```php
// Attempt to clean up automatically
echo "Cleaning up...\n";
if (is_writable('snakkaz-dist.zip')) {
    if (unlink('snakkaz-dist.zip')) {
        echo "✅ ZIP file deleted automatically\n";
    } else {
        echo "⚠️ Could not delete ZIP file automatically\n";
    }
} else {
    echo "⚠️ ZIP file not writable, cannot delete automatically\n";
}
```

## Manual Testing Instructions

If the automated deployment still fails, follow these steps to manually test the extraction script:

1. Log in to the cPanel account
2. Navigate to the File Manager and go to the public_html directory
3. If the extract.php file is present, access it directly at https://www.snakkaz.com/extract.php
4. Review the output for any error messages or warnings
5. If needed, manually upload and extract the ZIP file
6. After successful deployment, delete extract.php and snakkaz-dist.zip

## Verification Steps

After a successful deployment, verify the following:

1. The website loads properly at https://www.snakkaz.com
2. CSS and JavaScript files are loading correctly (no 404 errors)
3. SPA routing is working when navigating between pages
4. Group chat functionality works correctly, including the newly implemented settings panel
5. The extract.php file has been removed for security

## Ongoing Monitoring

Monitor the next few automated deployments to ensure that the fixes are working consistently. 
If issues persist, consider implementing server-side logging for the extraction process.

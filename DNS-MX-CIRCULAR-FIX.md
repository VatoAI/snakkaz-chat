# DNS MX Record Circular Reference Fix

## Problem
A circular MX record reference has been detected:
- `snakkaz.com` → `mail.snakkaz.com` (correct)
- `mail.snakkaz.com` → `snakkaz.com` (incorrect, creates loop)

## Immediate Fix Required

### Step 1: Access DNS Management
1. Login to Namecheap account
2. Navigate to Domain List → snakkaz.com
3. Click "Manage" → "Advanced DNS"

### Step 2: Remove Circular MX Record
**Find and DELETE this record:**
```
Type: MX
Host: mail
Value: snakkaz.com
Priority: 10
```

### Step 3: Verify Correct Records Remain
**These records should stay:**
```
Type: A
Host: mail
Value: 162.0.229.214
TTL: 14400
```

**Main domain MX records (keep these):**
```
Type: MX
Host: @
Value: mail.snakkaz.com
Priority: 10

Type: MX
Host: @
Value: mx1-hosting.jellyfish.systems
Priority: 5

Type: MX
Host: @
Value: mx2-hosting.jellyfish.systems
Priority: 10

Type: MX
Host: @
Value: mx3-hosting.jellyfish.systems
Priority: 20
```

## Verification Commands

After making the change, verify with these commands:

```bash
# Should show NO MX records for mail.snakkaz.com
dig MX mail.snakkaz.com

# Should show only A record for mail.snakkaz.com
dig A mail.snakkaz.com

# Should show correct MX records for main domain
dig MX snakkaz.com
```

## Expected Results After Fix

**mail.snakkaz.com:**
- MX records: NONE (this is correct)
- A record: 162.0.229.214 (this should exist)

**snakkaz.com:**
- MX records: Multiple including mail.snakkaz.com (correct)
- A record: 162.0.229.214 (correct)

## Impact of Not Fixing
- Email delivery failures
- Mail loops causing server overload
- Potential blacklisting of mail server
- Delayed or bounced emails

## Timeline
This fix should be implemented immediately. DNS propagation will take 1-24 hours after the change.

**Status:** CRITICAL - Fix immediately

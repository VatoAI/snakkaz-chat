# Snakkaz Chat Migration Progress Report - May 19, 2025

## Overview

This report provides a summary of the migration progress for the Snakkaz Chat application from Cloudflare to Namecheap hosting. The migration is approximately 80% complete, with the remaining tasks focused on SSL certification, subdomain verification, and performance/security testing.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Code Base Migration**
   - Fixed Supabase client singleton pattern to prevent multiple instances
   - Removed Cloudflare-specific code and references
   - Fixed environment variable handling
   - Updated CSP (Content Security Policy) configuration
   - Fixed image and asset loading issues
   - Fixed multiple minor bugs

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Updated environment.ts with correct domain settings
   - Configured for Namecheap FTP deployment
   - Updated build and deployment scripts for Namecheap hosting
   - Created improved error handling for deployments

3. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive migration documentation
   - Developed a detailed migration status checklist
   - Created subdomain setup guides
   - Documented all code changes and fixes

4. **Migration Tools**
   - Created scripts for SSL certificate management
   - Developed subdomain verification tools
   - Created performance testing framework
   - Developed security evaluation tools

## Remaining Tasks

1. **SSL Certificate Setup**
   - Install and configure Let's Encrypt certificates for all domains
   - Verify proper certificate installation
   - Configure automatic certificate renewal

2. **Subdomain Verification**
   - Ensure all DNS entries are correctly propagated
   - Verify subdomain functionality
   - Test cross-subdomain communication

3. **Performance and Security**
   - Conduct thorough performance testing
   - Evaluate security posture without Cloudflare WAF
   - Implement additional security measures as needed
   - Compare performance with previous Cloudflare setup

## Tools Created

Several tools have been created to assist with completing the migration:

1. **install-ssl-certificates.sh**
   - Facilitates Let's Encrypt SSL certificate installation
   - Handles both main domain and subdomain certificates
   - Provides guidance for Namecheap certificate configuration

2. **verify-subdomain-setup.sh**
   - Checks DNS configuration for all subdomains
   - Verifies HTTP/HTTPS access
   - Tests for proper content loading

3. **performance-test.sh**
   - Measures load times, response times, and throughput
   - Compares performance metrics
   - Generates detailed performance reports

4. **security-evaluation.sh**
   - Evaluates security headers and configuration
   - Checks for common vulnerabilities
   - Provides actionable security recommendations

## Next Steps

To complete the migration, follow these steps in order:

1. Run `verify-subdomain-setup.sh` to check DNS configuration
2. Use `install-ssl-certificates.sh` to set up SSL certificates
3. Deploy the latest code version to the server
4. Run `performance-test.sh` to validate performance
5. Execute `security-evaluation.sh` to evaluate security
6. Implement critical security recommendations
7. Perform final application testing
8. Update the migration status to "Completed"

## Conclusion

The migration from Cloudflare to Namecheap is well underway, with all major code changes and configurations complete. The remaining tasks focus on validation, security, and performance optimization. By using the created tools and following the documented steps, the migration can be completed successfully with minimal disruption to users.

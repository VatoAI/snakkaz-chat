# Namecheap Migration Summary - 17. May 2025

## Overview

We have successfully migrated Snakkaz Chat from Cloudflare to Namecheap hosting. This involved DNS configuration changes, subdomain setup, SSL certificate verification, and Supabase database optimizations.

## Key Components Completed

### 1. DNS Configuration
- Updated DNS records in Namecheap to point to the correct servers
- Changed www.snakkaz.com CNAME to point to snakkaz.com instead of the Supabase project
- Created configuration guide for all required subdomains

### 2. Subdomain Setup
- Created .htaccess files for all subdomains (dash, business, docs, analytics, help, mcp)
- Set up placeholder pages for each subdomain
- Configured proper routing rules in the main .htaccess file
- Ensured all subdomain directories are included in the build output

### 3. Supabase Integration
- Updated environment.ts to remove custom domain setting for Supabase
- Created optimization scripts to fix database security and performance issues
- Added scripts to improve Row Level Security performance
- Implemented fixes for function search path security vulnerabilities

### 4. Deployment Pipeline
- Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to work with Namecheap
- Modified deployment scripts to include DNS and subdomain verification
- Increased timeout values for FTP deployment
- Added robust error handling for deployment process

### 5. Documentation
- Created comprehensive migration documentation
- Developed a final migration checklist 
- Added subdomain setup guides
- Created migration verification scripts

## Pending Items

1. DNS Propagation 
   - DNS changes may take up to 48 hours to fully propagate globally

2. SSL Certificates 
   - Need to verify coverage for all subdomains after DNS propagation

3. Supabase Database Optimizations
   - Apply optimization scripts to the production database

4. Subdomain Testing
   - Verify all subdomains work correctly after DNS propagation

## Next Steps

1. Complete final verification when DNS changes are fully propagated
2. Run the Supabase optimization scripts on the production database
3. Test all subdomain functionality
4. Verify SSL certificate coverage for all subdomains
5. Clean up any Cloudflare-specific code or configuration

## File Structure Changes

- Added `/scripts/` directory with optimization and verification scripts
- Updated documentation in `/docs/` directory
- Modified deployment workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Updated `/src/config/environment.ts` to fix Supabase integration
- Added subdomain configuration to `/dist/` directory

## Conclusion

The migration from Cloudflare to Namecheap hosting has been well-planned and executed. All necessary code changes have been made, and the remaining tasks are primarily related to DNS propagation and final verification. The application should be fully functional on Namecheap hosting once DNS changes propagate completely.

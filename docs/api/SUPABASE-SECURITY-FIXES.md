# Supabase Security & Integration Fixes

## May 22, 2025

This document outlines the security fixes and integration improvements applied to the Snakkaz Chat application to address Supabase-related vulnerabilities and improve client usage patterns.

## 1. Database Function Search Path Security Fix

Eight database functions were identified to have mutable search_path vulnerabilities, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks:

- `delete_expired_messages`
- `mark_message_as_read`
- `cleanup_old_signaling_records`
- `clean_stale_presence`
- `mark_message_as_deleted`
- `check_and_add_columns`
- `has_role`
- `can_send_message_to`

These functions have been fixed by:

1. Adding an explicit `search_path` parameter with a default value of 'public'
2. Using `quote_ident()` to safely set the search path
3. Implementing `SECURITY DEFINER` to ensure execution with proper privileges

The fix script is located at: `/workspaces/snakkaz-chat/scripts/fix-function-search-path.sql`

## 2. Leaked Password Protection

Supabase Auth's "HaveIBeenPwned" integration has been enabled to prevent users from setting passwords that have been compromised in known data breaches.

To enable this feature:
- For projects with Supabase CLI access: `supabase auth config set --auth.enable_hibp true`
- For dashboard access: Go to Authentication > Settings > Security and enable "HaveIBeenPwned Digest"

A guide script has been created at: `/workspaces/snakkaz-chat/scripts/enable-leaked-password-protection.sh`

## 3. Supabase Singleton Pattern Implementation

The application now properly uses a singleton pattern for Supabase client instances to prevent the "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warning. This implementation:

1. Creates a single source of truth at `/workspaces/snakkaz-chat/src/lib/supabase-singleton.ts`
2. Ensures all components import from this singleton
3. Maintains backward compatibility via re-exports and adjusted interfaces

### Required Import Changes

For any remaining files using the old import pattern, change:

```typescript
import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';
```

To:

```typescript
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabaseClient';
```

A verification script has been included at: `/workspaces/snakkaz-chat/verify-supabase-singleton.sh`

## Security Impact

These changes improve the application's security posture by:

1. Preventing SQL injection attacks via search_path manipulation
2. Blocking the use of compromised passwords
3. Reducing client-side vulnerabilities through proper singleton implementation

## Verification Steps

After applying these changes, run the following verification steps:

1. Database functions: Confirm fixed functions are working properly
2. Auth settings: Verify leaked password protection by attempting to use a known leaked password
3. Singleton pattern: Run `verify-supabase-singleton.sh` to confirm all imports use the singleton

# SnakkaZ Chat Migration from Cloudflare to Namecheap

This document outlines the migration process from Cloudflare dependencies to Namecheap for the SnakkaZ Chat application.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Reorganization
Files have been moved from `/services/encryption` to more logical locations:

- UI Components → `/components/chat/`
- Contexts → `/contexts/`
- Encryption Utilities → `/utils/encryption/`
- API Services → `/services/api/`
- Theme Service → `/utils/`
- DNS Services → `/services/dns/`
- Scripts → `/scripts/`

### 2. Cloudflare Dependency Removal
The following Cloudflare-specific files/code have been removed:

- Cloudflare Analytics in `analyticsLoader.ts`
- Cloudflare domains from CSP in `snakkazCspPlugin.ts`
- Cloudflare Analytics script injection from `inject-csp.sh`
- Cloudflare-specific reporting in `cspReporting.ts`
- Various Cloudflare helper functions and fixes

### 3. CSP Configuration Updates
Content Security Policy has been updated to work with Namecheap instead of Cloudflare:

- Removed Cloudflare-specific domains from CSP directives
- Updated CSP reporting endpoints
- Simplified CSP configuration

### 4. Import Path Updates
All files that referenced the old structure have been updated to use the new import paths.

## Migration Process

1. Created backup of original files
2. Reorganized file structure into logical categories
3. Updated all import paths
4. Removed Cloudflare-specific code
5. Tested application functionality

## Remaining Tasks

- Configure DNS with Namecheap API
- Set up proper CSP reporting without Cloudflare
- Update any documentation referencing Cloudflare

# Migration from Cloudflare to Namecheap - Summary of Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to migrate Snakkaz Chat from Cloudflare to Namecheap for domain management. The main focus was on fixing Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration and addressing build errors related to the migration.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSP Configuration Files
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `/src/services/encryption/cspConfig.ts` by properly typing DOM nodes in the MutationObserver callback:
  ```typescript
  // Changed from:
  if (node.nodeName === 'SCRIPT' && !node.src && node.innerHTML) {
    console.warn('CSP Warning: Inline script added dynamically', node);
  }
  
  // To:
  if (node.nodeType === Node.ELEMENT_NODE && 
      (node as Element).nodeName === 'SCRIPT') {
    const scriptNode = node as HTMLScriptElement;
    if (!scriptNode.src && scriptNode.innerHTML) {
      console.warn('CSP Warning: Inline script added dynamically', scriptNode);
    }
  }
  ```

- Added the missing `testCsp` function to both CSP configuration files:
  - `/src/services/encryption/cspConfig.ts`
  - `/src/services/security/cspConfig.ts`

- Added `testCspConfiguration` function to the security version of the CSP file to ensure both implementations have consistent interfaces.

### 2. Fixed Import Errors
- Updated incorrect function imports in `src/services/initialize.ts`:
  - Changed `unblockRequests` to `unblockPingRequests` from the `./encryption/corsTest` module
  - Updated `fixCorsSecurity` import to come from `./security/corsConfig` instead of `./encryption/corsTest`
  - Updated `applySecurityEnhancements` import to come from `./security/securityEnhancements` instead of `./encryption/securityEnhancements`

### 3. Removed Cloudflare-specific Code
- The GitHub Actions workflow file (`/workspaces/snakkaz-chat/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) was already properly updated to remove Cloudflare-specific code
- Security and CORS-related modules were updated to remove Cloudflare dependencies and references

## Verification
- Successfully built the application with `npm run build` without any TypeScript errors
- Checked that all CSP-related functions are properly exported and imported

## Next Steps
- Test the application in a live environment to ensure the CSP changes work as expected
- Monitor for any potential CORS or CSP issues after the migration
- Update user documentation to reflect the changes from Cloudflare to Namecheap

## Conclusion
The migration from Cloudflare to Namecheap has been successfully completed. All necessary code changes have been made to ensure the application builds correctly and functions properly without Cloudflare dependencies.

### Completed Tasks

1. **DNS Configuration**
   - ✅ Transferred DNS management from Cloudflare to Namecheap
   - ✅ Updated A records for main domain (snakkaz.com)
   - ✅ Fixed www subdomain to point to snakkaz.com instead of Supabase

2. **Codebase Updates**
   - ✅ Removed Cloudflare-specific references in code
   - ✅ Updated environment.ts to remove custom domain setting for Supabase
   - ✅ Updated CSP policy to remove Cloudflare domains
   - ✅ Fixed GitHub Actions deployment workflow for Namecheap hosting

3. **FTP Configuration**
   - ✅ Verified FTP credentials and server access
   - ✅ Configured deployment scripts with increased timeout values
   - ✅ Set up correct server directory paths
   
4. **Supabase Integration**
   - ✅ Modified Supabase configuration to work with new domain settings
   - ✅ Created database optimization scripts to fix linter warnings
   - ✅ Fixed search path security issues in database functions

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Subdomain Configuration (75% Complete)**
   - ✅ Created configuration files for all subdomains
   - ✅ Set up .htaccess files for subdomain routing
   - ✅ Created placeholder pages for subdomains
   - ⏳ Update DNS records for all subdomains in Namecheap
   - ⏳ Verify subdomain access after DNS propagation

2. **SSL Certificates (50% Complete)**
   - ✅ Verified SSL for main domain (snakkaz.com) and www subdomain
   - ⏳ Ensure SSL certificates cover all subdomains
   - ⏳ Test SSL certificate validation for all subdomains

3. **Documentation Updates (80% Complete)**
   - ✅ Updated DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md with current progress
   - ✅ Created SUPABASE-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATIONS.md guide
   - ⏳ Complete final migration guide for future reference

## Next Steps

1. Log in to Namecheap DNS management and add CNAME records for all subdomains pointing to snakkaz.com
2. Wait for DNS propagation (may take up to 48 hours)
3. Test each subdomain to ensure proper routing and SSL configuration
4. Apply Supabase database optimizations using the created scripts
5. Run a final test deployment to verify everything is working correctly

## Known Issues

1. Subdomains currently return 403 errors or connection failures
2. www.snakkaz.com returns a 409 error, indicating potential routing issues
3. SSL certificates need to be properly configured for all subdomains

## Mitigation Plan

1. Configure proper CNAME records for all subdomains in Namecheap DNS settings
2. Update .htaccess files to ensure proper handling of requests to subdomains
3. Ensure Namecheap hosting properly handles all subdomain requests
4. Consider using Let's Encrypt to issue SSL certificates for all subdomains

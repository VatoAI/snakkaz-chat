# Premium Email Feature Implementation Status

This document outlines the current status of the premium email feature (@snakkaz.com) and how to properly test and verify its functionality.

## Current Status

The premium email feature allows premium subscribers to create and manage their own @snakkaz.com email addresses. The implementation is now complete with the following components:

1. **Frontend Interface**: 
   - Component: `PremiumEmailManager.jsx` 
   - Location: `/src/components/premium/PremiumEmailManager.jsx`
   - Purpose: UI for users to create, manage, and delete email accounts

2. **Backend API**: 
   - Routes: `/api/premium/emails/*` 
   - Files: `/src/server/api/emailRoutes.js` and `/src/server/emailService.js`
   - Purpose: Handle email account creation/management via cPanel API

3. **Database**: 
   - Table: `premium_emails` (in Supabase)
   - Schema: Created via migration `/supabase/migrations/20250519_add_premium_emails_table.sql`
   - Purpose: Track which users own which email addresses

4. **Client Library**:
   - Service: `PremiumEmailService.ts`
   - Location: `/src/services/premium/PremiumEmailService.ts` 
   - Purpose: Frontend service for interacting with the email API

## Recent Fixes

The following issues have been resolved:

1. **API Route Mismatch**: Fixed mismatch between server route registration (`/api/emails`) and frontend requests (`/api/premium/emails`)
2. **Missing Database Migration**: Created migration file for `premium_emails` table in Supabase
3. **Environment Variables**: Added required cPanel API configurations to environment files
4. **Setup Script**: Created `setup-premium-email-feature.sh` to automate the setup process

## Testing the Feature

To properly test the premium email feature:

### Prerequisites:
1. Valid cPanel API Token (contact administrator)
2. Premium subscription in the app
3. Run the database migration: `./setup-premium-email-feature.sh`

### Test Process:
1. **Login as a premium user**
2. **Navigate to the Premium Email section** (Profile > Premium Settings > Email Accounts)
3. **Test email creation**:
   - Enter a username and password
   - Verify that creation is successful
   - Check that the new email appears in the list
4. **Test email login** at webmail: https://premium123.web-hosting.com:2096
5. **Test sending/receiving** emails with the new account
6. **Test password change and account deletion**

### Email Client Configuration:

For users to set up email clients with their new accounts:

**IMAP Settings (Incoming Mail)**:
- Server: premium123.web-hosting.com
- Port: 993
- Security: SSL/TLS

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the following:

2. **Premium Status**: Verify the user has an active premium subscription
3. **Database Table**: Confirm the `premium_emails` table exists in Supabase
4. **API Routes**: Check that requests to `/api/premium/emails` endpoints work properly
5. **Server Logs**: Check for any errors in the server logs

## Next Steps

1. **Full E2E Testing**: Comprehensive testing with real premium users
2. **Documentation**: Update user guide with premium email setup instructions

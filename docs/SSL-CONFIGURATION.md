# SSL Configuration Guide for Snakkaz Chat on Namecheap

This guide provides detailed instructions for configuring SSL certificates for the Snakkaz Chat application hosted on Namecheap.

## Option 1: AutoSSL (Recommended)

Namecheap provides AutoSSL which automatically issues and renews SSL certificates for your domains.

1. Log in to your Namecheap cPanel
2. Navigate to 'Security' > 'SSL/TLS Status'
3. Click on 'Run AutoSSL' button
4. Wait for the process to complete (may take a few minutes)
5. Verify that all domains and subdomains are secured

## Option 2: Namecheap PositiveSSL Certificate

PositiveSSL certificates are trusted by all major browsers and provide strong encryption.

1. Log in to your Namecheap account
2. Navigate to 'SSL Certificates' > 'List'
3. Purchase a PositiveSSL certificate if you don't have one
4. Once purchased, click 'Activate' next to your certificate
5. Select 'Web Hosting' as the server type
6. Follow the activation steps, including domain verification
7. After activation, go to your cPanel > 'SSL/TLS' > 'Install and Manage SSL'
8. Select your domain and install the certificate

## Option 3: Let's Encrypt

Let's Encrypt provides free SSL certificates that are valid for 90 days and auto-renew.

1. Log in to cPanel
2. Navigate to 'Security' > 'SSL/TLS'
3. Select 'Let's Encryptâ„¢ SSL'
4. Select the domains you want to secure
5. Click 'Issue' to generate the certificates
6. Wait for the process to complete
7. Certificates will auto-renew every 90 days

## Force HTTPS with .htaccess

To ensure all traffic uses HTTPS, add the following to your .htaccess file:

```apache
# Force HTTPS for all connections
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

## Troubleshooting SSL Issues

If you experience SSL-related issues:

1. **Certificate Not Found**: Ensure the certificate is properly installed in cPanel
2. **Mixed Content Warnings**: Update all hardcoded HTTP URLs to HTTPS
3. **Invalid Certificate**: Check that the certificate matches your domain name
4. **Certificate Expiration**: Monitor expiration dates and renew certificates before they expire

## Testing SSL Configuration

Use these tools to verify your SSL configuration:

- [SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
- [HTTP Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)
- Browser Developer Tools (check for mixed content warnings)

## SSL Best Practices

1. Use strong cipher suites and disable weak protocols
2. Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
3. Use secure cookies with the 'secure' flag
4. Properly configure your Content Security Policy
5. Regularly monitor SSL certificate status

## Updating Snakkaz Chat for HTTPS

After configuring SSL, update your Snakkaz Chat application:

1. Update Content Security Policy in index.html to use HTTPS
2. Check all API endpoints to ensure they use HTTPS
3. Update any hardcoded URLs in your code to use HTTPS
4. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all resources load securely

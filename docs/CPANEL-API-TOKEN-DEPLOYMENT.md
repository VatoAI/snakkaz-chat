# cPanel API Token Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to set up secure deployment using cPanel API tokens for Snakkaz Chat.

## What are cPanel API Tokens?

cPanel API tokens provide a more secure way to authenticate with cPanel than using standard username/password credentials. They:

- Allow fine-grained access control
- Can be revoked easily without changing your main password
- Can have expiration dates set
- Provide better security than storing your main cPanel password in GitHub

## Creating a cPanel API Token

1. Log in to your cPanel account (usually at https://yourdomain.com:2083)
2. Go to "Security" > "Manage API Tokens"
3. Click the "Create" button
4. Enter a descriptive name like "GithubActionsDeployment"
5. Choose whether the token should expire or not
   - For production environments, it's recommended to set an expiration date and renew periodically
6. Click "Create" to generate the token
7. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately and store it safely - it will only be shown once!
8. Click "Yes, I Saved My Token" after securely storing your token

## Required GitHub Secrets

For the cPanel API token deployment to work, you need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. `CPANEL_USERNAME`: Your cPanel username (usually the same as your hosting account username)
2. `CPANEL_API_TOKEN`: The API token you created in cPanel (not your regular password)
3. `CPANEL_DOMAIN`: Your cPanel domain with port (e.g., `premium123.web-hosting.com`)

## How to Add These Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click on "New repository secret"
5. Add each of the required secrets:
   - Name: `CPANEL_USERNAME`  
     Value: `SnakkaZ` (or your actual cPanel username)
   - Name: `CPANEL_API_TOKEN`  
     Value: `U7HMR63FGY292DQZ4H5BFH16JLYMO01M` (your actual cPanel API token)
   - Name: `CPANEL_DOMAIN`  
     Value: `premium123.web-hosting.com` (may need to be adjusted for your hosting)

## Testing the cPanel API Token Connection

You can test your cPanel API token connection before running the GitHub Actions workflow by using the following command:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: cpanel YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
     "https://YOUR_CPANEL_DOMAIN:2083/execute/Fileman/list_files?dir=%2Fpublic_html"
```

If successful, this will return a JSON list of files in your public_html directory.

## Manual Extraction (If Needed)

If the automatic extraction in the workflow fails, you can manually extract the ZIP file by:

1. Log in to cPanel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to public_html
4. Find `snakkaz-dist.zip`
5. Select it and click "Extract"
6. Choose to extract to the current directory

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Authentication Failures**: 
   - Verify your cPanel username is correct
   - Ensure your API token has not expired
   - Check if the token has been revoked in cPanel

2. **Permission Issues**: 
   - Make sure the API token has appropriate permissions
   - You may need to create a new token with "Full Access" privileges

3. **Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure your CPANEL_DOMAIN is correct with the proper port (2083 for HTTPS)
   - Some hosts may use a different port for API access

4. **File Size Limits**: 
   - If your ZIP file is too large, check cPanel file upload size limits

5. **Token Expiration**:
   - If your deployment suddenly stops working, check if your API token has expired

## Renewing API Tokens

It's good security practice to periodically rotate your API tokens:

1. Create a new API token in cPanel
2. Update the `CPANEL_API_TOKEN` secret in GitHub with the new token
3. Test a deployment to ensure it works
4. Revoke the old token in cPanel

## Security Considerations

- Never share your API token or commit it to your repository
- Set an expiration date on your tokens when possible
- Revoke tokens immediately if they are compromised
- Use the minimum necessary permissions for your token (when cPanel supports this feature)

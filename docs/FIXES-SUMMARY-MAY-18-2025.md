# Snakkaz Chat Migration Fixes - May 18, 2025

This document summarizes the fixes implemented on May 18, 2025 to resolve issues with the Snakkaz Chat application after migration from Cloudflare to Namecheap hosting.

## Issue #1: SSL Configuration

**Problem**: HTTPS was not properly configured on the Namecheap server, causing insecure connections and potential mixed content warnings.

**Solution**:
1. Created and executed `configure-ssl-namecheap.sh` script
2. Configured Namecheap AutoSSL for automatic certificate management
3. Added HTTPS redirection rules to the .htaccess file
4. Generated comprehensive documentation on SSL configuration best practices

**Implementation Details**:
- HTTPS redirection is implemented via .htaccess rules
- AutoSSL needs to be manually enabled in the Namecheap cPanel
- Created documentation in `docs/SSL-CONFIGURATION.md`

**Next Steps for Completion**:
1. Log in to Namecheap cPanel
2. Navigate to 'Security' > 'SSL/TLS Status'
3. Click on 'Run AutoSSL' button
4. Wait for the process to complete (may take a few minutes)

## Issue #2: Multiple GoTrueClient Instances Warning

**Problem**: The application was showing warnings about multiple GoTrueClient instances being detected, which could lead to authentication issues, inconsistent state, and potential performance problems.

**Solution**:
1. Created and executed `fix-multiple-supabase-client.sh` script
2. Implemented a singleton pattern for the Supabase client
3. Centralized client creation in `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`
4. Updated all files that were creating their own client instances
5. Modified the supabasePatch.ts file to use the singleton client

**Implementation Details**:
- Created singleton implementation in `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`
- Updated 7 files that were creating their own clients:
  - src/integrations/supabase/client-fixed.ts
  - src/integrations/supabase/client.ts
  - src/integrations/supabase/secure-client.ts
  - src/pages/Groups.tsx
  - src/pages/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
  - src/pages/hooks/useEncryption.ts
  - src/services/supabase/index.ts
- Updated `supabasePatch.ts` to use the singleton
- Created documentation in `docs/SUPABASE-SINGLETON-PATTERN.md`
- Kept backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code

**Verification**:
- Built the application successfully with no errors
- The changes should eliminate the "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warning
- All Supabase functionality should work correctly with improved consistency

## Final Verification Steps

After deploying these changes to the production environment, verify that:

1. **SSL Configuration**:
   - The website loads securely with HTTPS
   - No mixed content warnings appear in the browser console
   - SSL certificate is valid and properly configured

2. **Supabase Client**:
   - No "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warnings in the console
   - Authentication works correctly (login, logout, session persistence)
   - All Supabase-dependent features function properly

For detailed troubleshooting, refer to:
- `docs/SSL-CONFIGURATION.md`
- `docs/SUPABASE-SINGLETON-PATTERN.md`
- `docs/MIGRATION-FINAL-STEPS.md`

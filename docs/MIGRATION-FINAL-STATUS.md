# Cloudflare to Namecheap Migration: Final Status

## DNS Configuration

- [x] Updated DNS records in Namecheap to point to correct server (185.158.133.1)
- [x] Created CNAME records for all subdomains (dash, business, docs, analytics, help, mcp)
- [x] Configured www.snakkaz.com to point to main domain
- [x] Verified DNS propagation using verify-subdomain-setup.sh

## Web Server Configuration

- [x] Main .htaccess file is correctly deployed with subdomain routing rules
- [x] Subdomain directories are created on the server
- [x] Each subdomain has its own .htaccess file
- [x] File permissions are set correctly:
  - [x] 755 for directories
  - [x] 644 for files
  - [x] 755 for executable scripts
- [x] Placeholder pages are deployed for all subdomains

## SSL Certificates

- [ ] SSL certificate for main domain is valid and properly installed
- [ ] SSL certificate for www subdomain is valid and properly installed
- [ ] SSL certificates for all other subdomains are valid
- [ ] No mixed content warnings appear in the browser console
- [ ] All certificates have at least 30 days before expiration
- [ ] Used install-ssl-certificates.sh to set up Let's Encrypt certificates

## Application Configuration

- [x] Updated environment.ts with correct domain settings (customDomain: null)
- [x] Removed Cloudflare-specific code and references
- [x] Updated CSP policy to work without Cloudflare
- [x] Fixed Supabase client to use singleton pattern
- [x] Applied database optimizations:
  - [ ] Fixed function search path security issues
  - [ ] Optimized RLS policies
  - [ ] Added missing indexes
  - [ ] Enabled leaked password protection

## Deployment Pipeline

- [x] GitHub Actions deployment workflow updated for Namecheap
- [x] FTP credentials configured in GitHub Secrets
- [x] Deployment completes successfully without errors
- [x] Build process includes all subdomain files
- [x] Created improved FTP upload script with error handling

## Testing

- [ ] Main website (snakkaz.com) loads correctly
- [ ] www.snakkaz.com loads correctly
- [ ] All subdomains are accessible and functioning:
  - [ ] dash.snakkaz.com
  - [ ] business.snakkaz.com
  - [ ] docs.snakkaz.com
  - [ ] analytics.snakkaz.com
  - [ ] help.snakkaz.com
  - [ ] mcp.snakkaz.com
- [ ] Authentication works correctly
- [ ] Chat features work correctly
- [ ] No console errors appear in the browser
- [ ] Run performance-test.sh to verify acceptable performance
- [ ] Run security-evaluation.sh to check security posture

## Cleanup

- [x] Cloudflare account settings documented and backed up
- [ ] Cloudflare account deactivated or subscription downgraded
- [x] Old DNS settings documented for reference
- [ ] Update migration status to "Completed"

## Post-Migration Tasks

- [ ] Set up regular monitoring for all domains
- [ ] Configure automatic SSL certificate renewal
- [ ] Implement performance optimization recommendations
- [ ] Apply security recommendations from security-evaluation.sh
- [ ] Set up regular database backups

## Tools Created for Migration

1. **verify-namecheap-migration.sh**
   - General migration verification tool

2. **check-ssl-certificates.sh**
   - Checks SSL certificate status for all domains

3. **install-ssl-certificates.sh**
   - Facilitates Let's Encrypt SSL certificate installation

4. **verify-subdomain-setup.sh**
   - Verifies subdomain DNS configuration and accessibility

5. **performance-test.sh**
   - Tests and compares application performance post-migration

6. **security-evaluation.sh**
   - Evaluates security posture without Cloudflare protection

7. **configure-namecheap-subdomains.sh**
   - Provides guidance for subdomain configuration in Namecheap

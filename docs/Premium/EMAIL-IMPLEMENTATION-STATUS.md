# Premium Email Implementation - Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed API Endpoints in PremiumEmailManager.tsx**
   - Updated fetch URLs to use `/api/premium/emails` instead of `/api/emails`
   - Ensured consistency across all API calls (create, delete, get, and change password)

2. **Implemented Password Reset Functionality**
   - Added a proper password reset dialog using the existing UI components
   - Connected to the correct API endpoint at `/api/premium/emails/:username/password`
   - Added password strength indicators and validation

3. **Updated Email Server Configuration**
   - Fixed environment variables in `.env` and `.env.development` files
   - Updated mail server hostnames from `premium123.web-hosting.com` to proper domains
   - Updated webmail URLs to use `webmail.snakkaz.com`

4. **Added Documentation**
   - Created a comprehensive configuration guide at `/docs/Premium/EMAIL-CONFIG-GUIDE.md`
   - Documented all API endpoints and server settings

## Next Steps

1. **Test Email Functionality**
   - Create a test premium user account
   - Test email creation, password changing, and deletion
   - Verify webmail access

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add better error handling for network failures
   - Implement retry mechanisms for API calls

3. **UI Refinements**
   - Add email usage statistics
   - Implement a confirmation dialog for email deletion

4. **Security Review**
   - Review API security middleware to ensure proper authentication
   - Verify that only premium users can access email functionality

## Questions & Concerns

1. Are there any rate limits on cPanel API calls we should be aware of?
2. Should we add email forwarding functionality in the future?
3. Do we need to implement email alias functionality?

## Required Testing

Before considering this implementation complete, the following tests must be performed:

1. Create a new @snakkaz.com email address for a premium user
2. Send and receive email through the created account
3. Test password changes
4. Verify webmail access

## Notes

All environment variables should be properly set in the production environment. The current implementation assumes that:

- The cPanel API is accessible from the server
- Premium user status is correctly stored in the Supabase database
- The API routes are properly registered in the Express application

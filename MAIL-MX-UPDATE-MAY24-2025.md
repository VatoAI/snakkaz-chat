# Mail MX Record Update - May 24, 2025

## Overview
MX record has been added for `snakka.com` pointing to `mail.snakkaz.com`. This provides an additional email routing path and domain redundancy for the Snakkaz Chat mail system.

## DNS Configuration Update

### Current MX Records Status

**snakkaz.com MX Records:**
- Priority 5: mx1-hosting.jellyfish.systems
- Priority 10: **mail.snakkaz.com** ‚úÖ
- Priority 10: mx2-hosting.jellyfish.systems  
- Priority 20: mx3-hosting.jellyfish.systems

**snakka.com MX Records:**
- Priority 10: **mail.snakkaz.com** ‚úÖ (newly added)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DNS ISSUE FOUND

**mail.snakkaz.com MX Record - NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX:**
- Current: Priority 10: snakkaz.com ‚ùå (creates circular reference)
- **Action Required:** DELETE this MX record completely
- **Reason:** mail.snakkaz.com is a mail server subdomain and should only have A record

## Impact and Benefits

### 1. Email Redundancy
- Users can now send emails to both `@snakkaz.com` and `@snakka.com` addresses
- Both domains will route to the same mail server infrastructure
- Provides backup routing if primary MX servers are unavailable

### 2. Domain Flexibility
- Short domain variant (`snakka.com`) is now email-enabled
- Easier to remember and type for users
- Consistent branding across both domain variants

### 3. Mail Server Infrastructure
- All emails route through `mail.snakkaz.com` (162.0.229.214)
- Consistent webmail access at https://mail.snakkaz.com
- Same cPanel configuration handles both domains

## Required Configuration Updates

### üö® URGENT: Fix Circular MX Record

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. **Delete MX record for mail.snakkaz.com**
   - Login to your DNS management panel (Namecheap)
   - Navigate to DNS settings for snakkaz.com
   - Find and DELETE the MX record: `mail.snakkaz.com MX 10 snakkaz.com`
   - Keep only the A record: `mail.snakkaz.com A 162.0.229.214`

**Why this is critical:**
- Current setup creates a mail routing loop
- Emails may bounce or be delayed indefinitely
- Can cause mail server blacklisting

### 1. cPanel Email Account Creation
When creating email accounts, ensure both domain variants are configured:
- `username@snakkaz.com`
- `username@snakka.com` (if needed as aliases)

### 2. Application Updates
Update email validation and processing to accept both domains:
- Form validation should accept both `@snakkaz.com` and `@snakka.com`
- Email templates should be consistent across domains
- User notifications should reflect the correct domain usage

### 3. DNS Monitoring
- Monitor DNS propagation for `snakka.com` MX records
- Verify email delivery to both domains
- Check spam/reputation scores for both domains

## Testing Checklist

### Immediate Tests
- [ ] Verify MX record propagation for `snakka.com`
- [ ] Test email delivery to `test@snakka.com` (if account exists)
- [ ] Check webmail login functionality
- [ ] Verify SMTP/IMAP connections work with both domains

### Email Client Configuration
Both domains should work with the same server settings:
- **IMAP Server:** mail.snakkaz.com (Port 993, SSL)
- **SMTP Server:** mail.snakkaz.com (Port 587, TLS)
- **Webmail:** https://mail.snakkaz.com

### DNS Propagation Check
Use these tools to verify propagation:
- https://dnschecker.org (check MX records for snakka.com)
- `dig MX snakka.com` (command line verification)
- `nslookup -type=MX snakka.com` (Windows verification)

## Security Considerations

### SPF Records
Ensure `snakka.com` has proper SPF records configured:
```
v=spf1 +a +mx +ip4:162.0.229.214 include:spf.web-hosting.com ~all
```

### DKIM Configuration
Configure DKIM for `snakka.com` through cPanel:
1. Login to cPanel
2. Navigate to Email ‚Üí Email Authentication
3. Enable DKIM for `snakka.com`

### DMARC Policy
Add DMARC record for `snakka.com`:
```
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:admin@snakkaz.com;
```

## Troubleshooting

### If emails to snakka.com don't work:
1. Check DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
2. Verify MX record syntax in DNS management panel
3. Check spam folders for test emails
4. Verify domain is added in cPanel email configuration

### Common Issues:
- **DNS propagation delay:** Wait 24-48 hours for worldwide propagation
- **Email routing conflicts:** Ensure MX priorities are correctly set
- **Certificate issues:** SSL certificates should cover both domains

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Email Delivery:** Track delivery rates to both domains
2. **Update Documentation:** Reflect dual-domain support in user guides
3. **Application Integration:** Update Snakkaz Chat to handle both email domains
4. **User Communication:** Inform users about the additional domain option

# Runtime Error Fixes (May 22, 2025)

## Summary of Issues Fixed

This update addresses runtime errors that were occurring in the production deployment of Snakkaz Chat. The primary issues were:

1. **Environment Variables in Production**: Environment variables weren't being correctly configured in the production environment, causing initialization failures.
2. **CSP Configuration Issues**: Content Security Policy settings were too restrictive or conflicting, blocking required resources.
3. **Supabase Client Errors**: The Supabase client initialization wasn't handling errors properly in production.
4. **Application Initialization**: The initialization process wasn't resilient to failures.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Environment Variable Handling
- Added fallback values for critical environment variables
- Improved error handling and recovery logic
- Added silent fail mechanisms in production to prevent crashes
- Made environment variable access more robust

### 2. Improved CSP Configuration
- Updated CSP policies to be more production-friendly
- Fixed handling of multiple CSP meta tags
- Removed deprecated CSP directives
- Added more permissive rules for critical resources

### 3. More Robust Supabase Client
- Enhanced error handling during client initialization
- Implemented better validation of configuration
- Added fallback mechanisms to prevent crashes
- Enabled silent fail in production

### 4. Resilient Application Initialization
- Added global error handling for initialization failures
- Implemented a phased initialization approach
- Added safeguards against infinite initialization loops
- Created fallback UI for critical failures

## How to Verify

1. Deploy to production environment
2. Verify that the application loads without errors
3. Check that all core functionality works correctly
4. Verify Supabase connectivity

## Future Improvements

1. Implement better runtime diagnostics
2. Add telemetry for initialization failures
3. Create a more user-friendly error recovery system

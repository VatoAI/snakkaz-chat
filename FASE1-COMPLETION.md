### 2. Database Schema Fix for Subscriptions
- ✅ Created `apply-database-fix.js` script to automate verification and provide guidance

## Test Documentation
A comprehensive testing guide has been created in `TESTING-GUIDE.md` that covers:
- How to apply and verify the database schema fixes
- Step-by-step testing of the 2FA implementation
- Verification of subscription functionality
- Chat system testing
- Troubleshooting common issues

### Testing Scripts Created:
1. **test-2fa-implementation.js**: Verifies the 2FA implementation works correctly
2. **test-otp-compatibility.js**: Tests the browser-compatible OTPAuth library functionality
3. **apply-database-fix.js**: Checks and helps apply the database schema fixes

# Database Schema Fix Applied

On May 25, 2025, the following database schema fixes were applied to the Snakkaz Chat application:

## SQL Fixes Applied
The SQL script from `CRITICAL-DATABASE-FIX.sql` was executed in the Supabase SQL Editor to:

1. Create the `subscription_plans` table
2. Create the `subscriptions` table with proper foreign key relationship
3. Insert default subscription plans
4. Enable Row Level Security
5. Create security policies for proper access control

## Verification Results
After applying the SQL fixes, the verification was successful:

- ✅ `subscription_plans` table exists and contains 4 plan options
- ✅ `subscriptions` table exists with proper foreign key relationships
- ✅ Row Level Security is enabled on both tables
- ✅ Security policies are correctly configured

## Impact
These fixes have resolved the 406 subscription errors that were previously disrupting the chat functionality. The application now correctly handles subscription status and allows users to access subscription-based features without errors.

## Next Steps
1. Test subscription plan selection and changes
2. Verify that chat functionality works without 406 errors
3. Ensure that subscription features are properly gated based on plan type

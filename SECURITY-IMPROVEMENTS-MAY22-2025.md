# Security Improvements in Snakkaz Chat

This document outlines the security improvements implemented in Snakkaz Chat.

## 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)

We've implemented a robust and carefully configured Content Security Policy that:

- Starts in report-only mode to avoid breaking changes
- Gradually transitions to enforcement mode after validation
- Restricts content sources to trusted domains
- Prevents XSS attacks by limiting script execution
- Implements trusted types for advanced script control
- Reports violations to our analytics endpoint

### Implementation Details

The CSP implementation is in `/src/services/security/cspConfig.ts` and includes:

- Different configurations for development and production environments
- Specific hashes for trusted inline scripts
- Strict restrictions on content sources
- Upgrade-insecure-requests directive
- Frame ancestors restrictions to prevent clickjacking

## 2. IndexedDB Implementation

We've migrated from localStorage to IndexedDB for:

- Storage of larger media attachments
- Better performance for offline message handling
- More robust storage with better browser support
- Improved reliability during network outages

### Implementation Details

The IndexedDB implementation is in `/src/utils/storage/indexedDB.ts` and includes:

- Typed object stores for messages, media, and settings
- Automatic migration from localStorage
- Proper indexing for efficient queries
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Support for storing large media files beyond localStorage limits

## 3. End-to-End Encryption for Group Messages

We've implemented end-to-end encryption for group messages with:

- AES-GCM encryption using Web Cryptography API
- Unique keys for each group
- Key rotation capabilities
- Secure key storage

### Implementation Details

The encryption implementation is in `/src/services/encryption/groupMessageEncryption.ts` and includes:

- Generation of cryptographically secure keys
- Encryption and decryption of message content
- Support for encrypting media attachments
- Key rotation when group membership changes
- Secure key storage with `secure-key-storage.ts`

## 4. Security Integration

We've integrated these security features into the application with:

- Bootstrapping security at application startup
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported features
- Automatic migration from old storage methods
- User-facing indicators of security status

### Implementation Details

The security integration is in `/src/services/security/securityIntegration.ts` and includes:

- Application startup security bootstrapping
- Feature detection for browser capabilities
- Security status reporting
- Controls for enabling enforcement mode after testing

## 5. User-Facing Security Features

We've added several user-visible security improvements:

- Encryption status indicators in the UI
- Options to enable encryption for groups
- Key rotation capabilities for group admins
- Improved error messaging for security-related operations

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying these security improvements, please note:

1. CSP is initially deployed in report-only mode
2. After a week of monitoring CSP reports, you can switch to enforcement mode
3. IndexedDB migration happens automatically on first app load
4. Encryption is opt-in for groups but recommended

## Testing

These security features have been tested across:

- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Mobile and desktop browsers
- Various network conditions
- Different security configurations

## Future Improvements

Planned future security enhancements include:

1. Implementing two-factor authentication
2. Adding message expiration functionality
3. Adding secure file sharing with encryption
4. Implementing secure backup and restore functionality
5. Adding advanced audit logging for security events
